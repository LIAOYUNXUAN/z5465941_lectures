Event Studies:
Key Point: Event studies analyze the financial impact of significant events.
Note: The study focuses on how specific events affect stock prices or financial metrics.
Example: Analyzing stock market reactions to corporate announcements.
Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) and Event Timing:
Observation: Changes in DCF are crucial around the event time.
Time Frame: Considering periods before (−ε) and after (ε) the event.
Simplification: Assuming P−ε (price before the event) equals Pε (price after the event) for analysis.
Assumption in Event Studies:
Assumption: Stock price remains constant before and after the event.
Implication: This helps isolate the direct effect of the event.
Analyzing the Impact of Events:
Scenario 1: If rε = 0, the event (like a downgrade) provided no new relevant information.
Scenario 2: Significant change in stock price indicates the event conveyed critical information.
Conclusion: This analysis helps understand the market's reaction to specific events.
